I vow to thee, my cheese, all earthly things above
Entire and whole and perfect, the taste of cheese
The love that asks no mold, the love that stands the test
That lays upon the altar, the dearest and the best
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.



Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know
We may not count her armies, we may not see her cheesecake
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering
And soul by soul, and silently her shining bounds increase
And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.
